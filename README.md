# What is Grade Tracker? ðŸ’¯

Grade Checker is a SW that helps you keep track of your scores and grades.

## How to start

You can clone from this directory and use source codes. 

However, you must use your own Firebase database to make it solely yours.

Make a Firebase database and replace this code with yours.

```jsx
var firebaseConfig = {
        apiKey: "AIzaSyCDCXU4a9qZwEzRevPx5pT0yW8Uu_zbt4I",
        authDomain: "gradetracker-9f956.firebaseapp.com",
        databaseURL: "https://gradetracker-9f956.firebaseio.com",
        projectId: "gradetracker-9f956",
        storageBucket: "gradetracker-9f956.appspot.com",
        messagingSenderId: "368658407712",
        appId: "1:368658407712:web:f7024d6989897988d6f745",
        measurementId: "G-VWNF2C8LLJ"
      };
//This section of code will be provided from Firebase
```

## How it works

It is basically a html page connected to a Firebase database.

We can read, write, delete the data in the database through html.

It may be used as a local html document or it can be hosted via a server.

To be able to use the Firebase in the html, we must insert some code sections in the html document via javascript.

```jsx
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.15.0/firebase-app.js"></script>
<script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/7.15.0/firebase-firestore.js"></script>
//code section to be able to use Firebase DB

firebase.initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
firebase.analytics();
const db = firebase.firestore();
//code section to initialize firebase in the html
```

To use the actual data from the FireBase DB, we can use the code below.

```jsx
db.collection('collection_name').orderBy('field_name').get().then((snapshot) => {
      //what you want to do
 });

db.collection('collection_name').doc('document_name').set()({
      //what you want to do
 });

//examples of code to read and write on Firebase DB
```

## How to Use

The interface is very simple.
There are maximum 8 pages you can use for each course you are taking.
There isn't much you can do, which makes it simple.
However, these few functionalities will be enough.

First, you can change the course name.
Click "course" button and enter a name you want.
You can check other courses on the left side menu. They also act as a link to each page.
<img src="example_images/course_button.jpg" ></img><br/>
![Alt text](example_images/course_button.jpg)
![Alt text](./example_images/side_menu.jpg)

Second, you can add a score element.
You need to provide what score it is (quiz1, midterm, etc.), its full score, your score, the percentage of it (the ratio).
![Alt text](./example_images/score_add.jpg)

Third, you can edit and delete a score element.
This part is very intuitive.... You can find it easy.
![Alt text](./example_images/edit_delete.jpg)

Forth, you can view the scores.
For each score element, you can check the score out of 100 that is calculated with the percentage.
![Alt text](./example_images/current_score.jpg)



This is the end.
I hope you enjoy it.
If there is any problem, feel free to leave a issue.

Also, you can view the overall score upto this point and check the expected maximum score out of 100.
